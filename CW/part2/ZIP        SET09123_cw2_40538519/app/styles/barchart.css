/*
CSS specificity priority:

- can use !important to override inline

Inline Styles: Styles applied directly to an element using the style attribute have the highest specificity.

ID Selectors: Selectors that use IDs (e.g., #myElement) have higher specificity than class selectors.

Class Selectors: Selectors that use class names (e.g., .myClass) have lower specificity than ID selectors but higher specificity than type selectors.

Type (Element) Selectors: Selectors that target HTML elements (e.g., div, p, a) have the lowest specificity.

Combinators: Combinators like the child combinator > increase specificity because they add another level of hierarchy to the selector.
