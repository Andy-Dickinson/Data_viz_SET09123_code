/*
CSS specificity priority:

Inline Styles: Styles applied directly to an element using the style attribute have the highest specificity.

ID Selectors: Selectors that use IDs (e.g., #myElement) have higher specificity than class selectors.

Class Selectors: Selectors that use class names (e.g., .myClass) have lower specificity than ID selectors but higher specificity than type selectors.

Type (Element) Selectors: Selectors that target HTML elements (e.g., div, p, a) have the lowest specificity.

Combinators: Combinators like the child combinator > increase specificity because they add another level of hierarchy to the selector.


/* gives bars a thicker and different coloured border when have class hightlight (by event)*/
g.chart > rect.bar.highlight{
    stroke-width: 2px;
    stroke: #282828;
    fill: lightgreen;
}

/* adds a rule for the bars themselves - fill and stroke (outline colour and width) 
selects all rectangles with class bar, where parent is a g element with class chart*/
g.chart > rect.bar {
    fill: #4aba57;
    stroke: #d3210d;
    stroke-width: 2px;
}
